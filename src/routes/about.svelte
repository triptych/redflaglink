<h1>About this project</h1>

<h2>These recruiters are just bad</h2>
<p>I don't know about you, but I don't want to waste time with recruiters who do not understand basics of the industry. This is not saying that the jobs offered by those companies are bad, I don't know anything about it. What I know is that they contacted me, despite completely ridiculous fake profile I published. </p>
<p>For me, this is a big red flag. I suspect most of them that they even does not read the profile itself, they just search for a keyword and send automated email to all fitting candidates. I think they can do better and I definitely think that I should be worth of few minutes to read the profile properly. </p>
<p>So, if you are looking for a job (particullary in software engineering) you are probably better off with different company than one of those listed on first page. If you are recruiter listed on the first page - think about your job. It is a great opportunity to help people. You are wasting your potential.</p>
